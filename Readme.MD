Node.js is a JavaScript runtime built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine. Node.js
uses an event-driven, non-blocking I/O model that makes it lightweight and
efficient. The Node.js package ecosystem, [npm][], is the largest ecosystem of
open source libraries in the world.

The Node.js project is supported by the
[Node.js Foundation](https://nodejs.org/en/foundation/). Contributions,
policies, and releases are managed under an
[open governance model](./GOVERNANCE.md).

**This project is bound by a [Code of Conduct][].**

If you need help using or installing Node.js, please use the
[nodejs/help](https://github.com/nodejs/help) issue tracker.
